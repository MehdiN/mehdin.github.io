The Flying Coworker Project[^1] aimed to develop a flying manipulator robot for human-robot collaborations.
This work was realized within this project and aim to develop intelligent perception able to take in account
the uncertainty found in human motion and observations.

We are looking to localize the human whole body in the environment and estimate the associated posture.
We are tackling the problem of human pose estimation through sensor data-fusion as we are aiming to 
take advantage of the monocular camera carried by a flying manipulator and inertial sensors worn by the human operator. 

The whole body posture is parametrized by 20 revolute joints, encoded with the XML URDF syntax,
allowing to compute the kinematics and the dynamics of the body model.
To obtain the 3D pose, we consider the 6D pose of the center of mass of the body,
associated with the center of the pelvis.

We are looking to estimate the following distributions:

- Distribution over the revolute joints $$\boldsymbol{\theta}$$
- Distribution over the 6D pose of the pelvis $$\boldsymbol{x}_{p}$$

Particle filtering was chosen for the following criteria:

- Bayesian framework for data fusion
- Allow modeling non-Gaussian and non-linear dynamics
- More robust for global localization problems

We fuse the extracted 2D pose from the video frames with the posture estimated from the inertial sensors.
However, to lower the computational cost associated with particle filtering, we suggest a
two stage estimation architecture for simultaneous pose and posture estimation:

- A first stage estimating the 20 joints configuration (posture) from inertial observations $$\boldsymbol{y}_{a}$$.
- Second stage estimating the whole body 3D pose from posture posterior $$p(\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t}\vert\boldsymbol{y}_{a,1:t})$$ and the 2D pose $$\boldsymbol{y}_{b}$$.

This architecture is allowed by the factorization of the inertial observations.
At the first stage, we estimate partially the distribution over the posture by estimating
the configuration for each sub-kinematic tree of the human body model.
We use a multiple particle filter as the first stage filter.

We reconstruct the distribution from the whole body posture in order to build the following proposal distribution:
\\[ 
  p(\boldsymbol{\theta}\_{t} \vert \boldsymbol{y}\_{a,1:t}) \sum_{k}^{N} w^k_{t-1} p(\boldsymbol{x}\_{p,t} \vert \boldsymbol{x}\_{p,t-1}^k)
\\]

- $$p(\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t} \vert \boldsymbol{y}_{a,1:t})$$ is given from the first stage.
- $$\sum_{k}^{N} w^k_{t-1} p(\boldsymbol{x}_{p,t} \vert \boldsymbol{x}_{p,t-1}^k)$$ is deduced from the previous particles of the second filter.

We can alternatively sample uniformly from the distribution over $$\boldsymbol{x}_p$$:

\\[ 
  p(\boldsymbol{\theta}\_{t} \vert \boldsymbol{y}\_{a,1:t}) \sum_{k}^{N} p(\boldsymbol{x}\_{p,t} \vert \boldsymbol{x}\_{p,t-1}^k)
\\]

This uniform sampling from previous particles on $$\boldsymbol{x}_p$$ allows to construct the proposal distribution much faster.
It allows as well to simplify the computation of the importance factor of the second stage filter:

\\[
    w_t^i = w_{t-1}^i \cdot p(\boldsymbol{y}\_{b,t} \vert \boldsymbol{x}_{p,t},\boldsymbol{\theta}_t)  
\\]

Compared to the vanilla particle filter, our filtering architecture allows better posture estimation 
with fewer particles. As seen in the image below, our estimation of the posture (right) is closer to the reference
posture (left) than the posture estimate of the vanilla filter (center).

Our contribution shows particle filtering is still relevant for online human pose estimation by leveraging the factorization of the state space
allowing us to construct an intermediate proposal distribution allowing to sample over the whole body pose.
We hope to revisit this work to include sampling motions and postures leveraging conditional dependencies over actions.
