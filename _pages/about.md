<!-- I am a postdoctoral researcher on probabilistic machine learning for robotics and human activity
analysis with a focus on uncertainty modeling. -->

I recently obtained my Ph.D from INRIA, Nancy Grand Est, France, supervised
by Dr. Francis Colas, Dr. Serena Ivaldi and Prof. Vincent Thomas.
Before, I have obtained my master degree and the title of engineer
from ENSTA Bretagne (Brest, France).
